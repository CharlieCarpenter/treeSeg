Description: For a given tree with binary or continuous observations at the tips, performs segmentation which corresponds to a set of inner nodes in the tree. The method is based on a multiscale approach. This controls the probability of overestimating the number of active nodes at level alpha and yields confidence statements for the set of active nodes and the success probabilities.
