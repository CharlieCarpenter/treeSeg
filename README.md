# treeSeg

For given phylogenetic tree with binary observations at the tips, the *treeSeg* algorithm performs segmentation which corresponds to a set of inner nodes in the tree. The method is based on a multiscale approach. This controls the probability of overestimating the number of active nodes at level alpha and yields confidence statements for the set of active nodes and the success probabilities. 

The treeSeg algorithm is implemented as an R package.

An example on how to use *treeSeg* can be found in the jupyter notebook in *illustrationTreeSeg.ipynb*.
